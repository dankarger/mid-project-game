### About the Project 

![alt text](./public/assets/images/readme/scrrenshot1.png)

- This project was a week assigment- part of  the **AppleSeed- BootCamp -2021**
- I wanted to learn to use animations with react, so I decided to make a game.
- There is an API (MockApi) that can store and Load Player.
- The current player is stored in the local storage
- I used art and drawings from the artist: [Alon-Gaash](https://alon-site.herokuapp.com//)
